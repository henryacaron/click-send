# click-send

Dark Forest's drag-to-send mechanism sucks for my laptop touchpad. I wrote this plugin to make it easier to send energy and gold between planets. 
The user clicks an origin planet and a destination planet and modifies the energy and silver to send. The plugin also lets the user see timing and exact energy/silver the destination receives. To cancel, the user simply clicks in empty space.
